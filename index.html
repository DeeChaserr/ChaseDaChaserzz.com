<h2><p style="color:green;font-size:150%;margin-left:20px;">The (YTN) official faction.</p>

<p><p style="color:white;font-size:150%;margin-left:20px;">📖 YTN (Young Threat Nation) – Background Story

YTN was born out of struggle, hunger, and the need for recognition. It started with a small group of young hustlers who grew up in the same blocks, where opportunities were slim and survival meant sticking together. They weren’t the strongest, the richest, or the oldest on the streets — but they carried something different: ambition and heart.

At first, YTN was just a neighborhood crew, defending their turf and looking out for each other. They gained their name because even though they were young, they moved with the presence of a real threat. They didn’t back down from anyone, no matter how big or established. Older gangs laughed at them at first, but that changed once YTN started making moves that couldn’t be ignored.

They became known for three things:

Loyalty – nobody outside the Nation could break their bond.

Fearlessness – they weren’t afraid to take risks or face off with bigger names.

Ambition – instead of being just another street crew, they aimed to build a legacy.

Over time, YTN grew from a block-level squad into a full-on faction, recruiting new members who shared the same hunger and drive. Every member carried the mindset of being the next threat, the next one up. Their name spread because of the way they handled business — quick, calculated, and never backing down.

Now, YTN stands as more than a gang; it’s a movement. To outsiders, it’s Young Threat Nation, but to those inside, it’s family, loyalty, and the belief that age or size don’t define power — mindset does.</p>

<p><p style="color:white;font-size:100%;margin-left:20px;">📜 YTN (Young Threat Nation) Rules
🔱 Loyalty & Respect

Respect the Founder, Co-Founders, and Leaders – their word is final.

Always show loyalty to YTN – no snaking, no switching sides, no betrayal.

Internal beef stays inside – don’t argue or fight in front of outsiders.

⚔️ War & Streets

Follow orders in wars and raids – no freelancing, move when called.

Don’t start random beef – YTN fights only when the call is made.

Never leave a member behind – always back up YTN in-game.

💰 Hustle & Business

Contribute to the grind – stores, trapping, and money feeds the faction.

Don’t scam, steal, or shortchange your own members – that’s a fast way out.

Store runners, trappers, and hustlers must report clean – no cutting the gang out.

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Conduct & Behavior

Keep YTN business in YTN – don’t leak, snitch, or expose chats.

No unnecessary drama, trolling, or spamming – stay focused.

Respect allies and neutrals – ops are ops, but don’t start side wars.

📈 Activity & Ranking

Activity = Promotion – put in work to move up ranks.

Inactivity without notice can lead to demotion or removal.

New recruits (Youngins) must prove loyalty before earning full trust.

🚫 Strict Off-Limits

No exploiting, hacking, or cheating in-game – automatic ban.

No snaking, leaking, or inside jobs – permanent blacklist.
